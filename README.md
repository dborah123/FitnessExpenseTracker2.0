# Fitness Expense Tracker
## Impetus
After moving to a completely new area of the country, I decided to try mountain biking in order to meet new people and get outdoors. My expectations were met as I now look forward to exploring the trails with friends.

However, something that I was not expecting was the constant need to purchase more bike equipment and replacement parts. Every few weeks, I'd find that I'd need to purchase a replacmeent tire tube or bike light so I could ride at night. As Strava user, my first question was "how many miles per dollar spent is this hobby getting me?". That is the question this application is trying to answer.

## App Description
This application is meant to track your fitness-related expenses. This can be things you actively use during the activity, such as equipment, parts, tickets. Or this can be other expenses such as gas or the burrito on the way back from a long day on the slopes. From there, this application is meant to provide insights into those spending habits.
